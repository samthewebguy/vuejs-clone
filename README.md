# Vue.js Website Clone (React & TailwindCSS)

This is a **fully custom React and TailwindCSS clone** of the [Vue.js website](https://vuejs.org), recreated from scratch as a personal project to showcase my **front-end development skills**, including component architecture, complex array mapping, and responsive UI engineering.

---

## Project Purpose

I chose to clone the Vue.js website because it’s a **large, detail-rich, and interaction-heavy** website. Rebuilding it using React allows me to demonstrate my ability to:

- Work with **nested and complex arrays of objects**
- Manage multiple **interactive dropdowns and menus** using `useState`
- Implement **clean component composition** for scalability
- Apply **responsive design principles** using TailwindCSS
- Handle **routing and external links** safely with React Router

This project reflects my approach to building **structured, maintainable, and production-ready** front-end applications.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

| Skill | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **React Fundamentals** | Component creation, props, state management, and event handling |
| **Complex Data Mapping** | Dynamic rendering of nested navigation, sponsors, and multi-level menus |
| **Tailwind CSS Mastery** | Fully responsive layout, custom hover effects, and dark theme styling |
| **State Logic & Interactivity** | Smooth dropdowns, toggles, and interactive UI states |
| **React Router Integration** | Seamless navigation and external linking |
| **Scalable Architecture** | Modular folder structure and reusable UI components |

## Tech Stack

- **React** — UI Framework  
- **Tailwind CSS** — Styling and layout  
- **useState & useEffect** — Managing interactive states  
- **React Router** — Routing and navigation  
- **Array & Object Mapping** — Dynamic content rendering  
- **Vite** — Lightning-fast development setup

## What I Learned

Working on this Vue.js clone taught me several valuable lessons:

- **Advanced React Patterns** – Handling nested data structures, dynamic rendering, and conditional components with map() and useState.
- **State Management Mastery** – Coordinating multiple dropdowns, toggles, and interactive UI elements without external libraries.
- **Tailwind CSS Techniques** – Building fully responsive layouts, custom hover effects, and dark mode styling efficiently.
- **Component Architecture** – Structuring a scalable and reusable component hierarchy for large websites.
- **Routing & External Links** – Using React Router to handle internal navigation and safely linking to external resources.
- **Problem-Solving & Debugging** – Translating a complex production site into a clean, maintainable React project.

This project reinforced how to combine design fidelity with React best practices, preparing me for real-world front-end challenges.
